# Oasis Infobyte Internship - Data Science Projects

Welcome to my Data Science internship project repository for Oasis Infobyte!
This repository showcases five real-world data science projects I successfully completed as part of my internship experience at Oasis Infobyte.

Through these projects, I applied data science and machine learning techniques to solve practical problems, strengthening my technical skills and gaining valuable hands-on exposure. I'm sharing this work to document my journey, highlight my capabilities to potential employers, and contribute to the data science community.
